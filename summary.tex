Baxter is a very friendly humanoid robot by Rethink Robotics. Baxter is all over the
world; in factories, research laboratories and also at the School of Computing at the
University of Leeds.

This work investigates several perception and manipulation algorithms to implement a
cashier robot. The main objective of this project is to make Baxter a fully capable cashier
that can accept payments in a proposed sweetshop and handle change.

In addition, this piece of work was integrated into last year’s project. The aim of last
year’s project was to make Baxter operator of a sweetshop.
