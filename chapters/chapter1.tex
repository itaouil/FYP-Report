\section{Context}

Rudimentary robots have been part of our lives since the early beginning of the industrial revolution. 

Nowadays we interact with servicing robots almost every day, starting from the toaster in the morning, to the TV and smart-phone for personal entertainment to automated security checking at the airports we travel through. 

This is an unstoppable trend and in the near future robots will increasingly become more and more present in human environments in a variety of areas like assistance, grunt work, military, logistics and security.

Humans' interactions are defined by a set of precise protocols, in fact none us would carelessly jump in front of a queue or invade someone else's space in a common environment without asking permission.

Robots to be able to integrate in such an environment, and more importantly for humans to accept such an integration, will have to comply to some ethical, moral and social rules that govern our way of being humans.

\section{Aim}

The aim of the project is to explore key-topics and main-ideas for human-aware navigation and human-robot interaction with the final goal of developing a software product able to make the robot detect human presence in a dynamic environment and give it the ability to join ongoing discussions maintaining critical spaces.

\section{Domain}

One of the first problems to be tackled in the project, is the ability of the robot to detect human presence within the environment. The detection outcome has to be accurate and resistant to noise as to avoid false positives or false negatives during the detection. 

The next step would require the robot to define a behavioral space model for the people detected, which is used to respect the discussion's area.

\section{Objectives}

The following objectives for the project are defined:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Explore, understand and gain experience with state-of-the-art robotics' algorithms for vision and navigation tasks.
  \item Obtain a level of proficiency in using the ROS platform and its tools.  
  \item Develop a human detection system using the robot's built-in sensors and cameras.
  \item Develop a human space model for human aware navigation.
  \item Develop a navigation system able to navigate in dynamic environments and act upon precise inputs.
\end{enumerate}
