I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Mehmet Dogar who throughout the second
semester have guided and helped me with several aspects of the project. During our
weekly meetings, he listened to my ideas and plans and he gave invaluable suggestions
and comments as well as alternative solutions when things did not turn to be as initially
planned or thought.

In addition, I would also like to thank my assessor, Professor Anthony Cohn. His early
feedback on Scoping and Planning document as well as his comments in the progress
meeting earlier in the project, helped me to identify some tricky parts of the project
as well as to make me aware of some difficulties I should expect from such a project,
especially about my estimation of tasks that in some cases I have underestimated.
Furthermore, I would like to thank my family for supporting me during this project and
their motivation they have given to me.

In addition, I would like to thank all of the participants that helped to test the end result.
Finally, I would like to thank Muhannad Al-Omari a PhD student at the School of Com-
puting since in my first days in the robotics laboratory helped me to get familiar and also
some feedback he gave mainly for the calibration tool.
