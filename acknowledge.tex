"He who does not thank people, does not thank God" (Prophet Muhammad).

I therefore would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Matteo Leonetti, for providing help and guidance throughout the project, freedom during the development and research stages and the possibility to use an expensive piece of technology like TIAGO.

I would also like to thank the project's assessor, Dr. Mehmet Dogar, for his useful feedback and for taking time in answering the many questions I had for him.
